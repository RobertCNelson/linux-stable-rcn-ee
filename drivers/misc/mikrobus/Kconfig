menuconfig MIKROBUS
	tristate "Module for instantiating devices on mikroBUS ports"
	help
	  This option enables the mikroBUS driver. mikroBUS is an add-on
	  board socket standard that offers maximum expandability with
	  the smallest number of pins. The mikroBUS driver helps in
	  instantiating devices on the mikroBUS port with identifier
	  data fetched from an EEPROM on the device.

	  Say Y here to enable support for this driver.

	  To compile this code as a module, chose M here: the module
	  will be called mikrobus.ko
