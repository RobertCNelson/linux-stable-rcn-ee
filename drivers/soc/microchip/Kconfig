	  This driver adds support for the PolarFire SoC (MPFS) system controller.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. the
	  module will be called mpfs_system_controller.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  The PolarFire SoC system controller is communicated with via a mailbox.
	  This driver implemtents the services provided by the system controller
	  which do not belong in a specific subsystem, such as reading the fpga
	  device certificate, all of which follow the same format:
	    - a command + optional payload sent to the sys controller
	    - a status + a payload returned to Linux

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. the
	  module will be called mpfs_generic_service.

	  If unsure, say N.
