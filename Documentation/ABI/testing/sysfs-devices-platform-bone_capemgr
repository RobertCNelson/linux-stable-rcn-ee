Description:
		READ:
		  Describe the state of all the slots of the beaglebone capemgr.
		  Each line of the output describes a slot:
		  The slot format is as following:
		  <slot-id>: [P-][F-][O-][l-][L-][D-] \
			  <overlay-id> <board-name>,<version>,
			  <manufacturer>,<part-number>

		Where the flags are:
		P: Slot has been probed
		F: Slot has failed probing (i.e. no EEPROM detected)
		O: Slot has been overridden by the user
		l: Slot is current loading
		L: Slot has completed loading and is ready
		D: Slot has been disabled

		Example:
		0: P---L-  -1 BeagleBone RS232 CAPE,00A1,Beagleboardtoys,BB-BONE-SERL-03
		1: PF----  -1
		2: PF----  -1
		3: PF----  -1

		WRITE:
		  Writing a string of the form <part-number>[:version] issues a request to
		  load a firmware blob containing an overlay. The name of the firmware blob
		  is <part-number>-[version|00A0].dtbo. This act is defined as a slot override.

		  Writing a negative slot id removes the slot if it was an overridden one, or
		  unloads a slot that was probed.
