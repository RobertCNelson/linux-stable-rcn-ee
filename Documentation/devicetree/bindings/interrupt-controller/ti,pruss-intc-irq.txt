PRU ICSS INTC on TI SoCs
========================

Each PRUSS has a single interrupt controller instance that is common to both
the PRU cores. Each interrupt controller can detect 64 input events which are
then mapped to 10 possible output interrupts through two levels of mapping. The
input events can be triggered by either the PRUs and/or various other PRUSS
internal and external peripherals. The first 2 output interrupts are fed
exclusively to the internal PRU cores, with the remaining 8 connected to
external interrupt controllers including the MPU.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible           : should be one of,
                             "ti,am3356-pruss-intc" for AM335x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am4376-pruss-intc" for AM437x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am5728-pruss-intc" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                             "ti,k2g-pruss-intc" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg                  : base address and size for the PRUSS INTC sub-module
- reg-names            : should contain the string "intc"
- interrupts     : all the interrupts generated towards the main host
                   processor in the SoC. The format depends on the
                   interrupt specifier for the particular SoC's MPU
                   parent interrupt controller
- interrupt-names: should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
                   the name should match the corresponding host interrupt
                   number,
                       "host2", "host3", "host4", "host5", "host6",
                       "host7", "host8" or "host9"
                   NOTE: AM437x and 66AK2G SoCs do not have "host7" interrupt
                         connected to MPU
- interrupt-controller : mark this node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells     : should be 1. Client users shall use the PRU System
                         event number (the interrupt source that the client
                         is interested in) as the value of the interrupts
                         property in their node

Example:
--------
		pruss_intc: intc@20000 {
			compatible = "ti,am3356-pruss-intc";
			reg = <0x20000 0x2000>;
			reg-names = "intc";
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <1>;
			interrupts = <20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27>;
			interrupt-names = "host2", "host3", "host4",
					  "host5", "host6", "host7",
					  "host8", "host9";
		};
