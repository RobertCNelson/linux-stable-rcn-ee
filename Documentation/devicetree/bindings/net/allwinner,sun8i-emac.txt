* Allwinner sun8i EMAC ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-emac", "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac",
		or "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac"
- reg: address and length of the register sets for the device.
- reg-names: should be "emac" and "syscon", matching the register sets
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
- clock-names: should be "ahb"
- resets: A phandle to the reset control for this device
- reset-names: should be "ahb"
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt
- phy or phy-handle: See ethernet.txt
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0

"allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac" also requires:
- clocks: an extra phandle to the reference clock for the EPHY
- clock-names: an extra "ephy" entry matching the clocks property
- resets: an extra phandle to the reset control for the EPHY
- resets-names: an extra "ephy" entry matching the resets property

See ethernet.txt in the same directory for generic bindings for ethernet
controllers.

The device node referenced by "phy" or "phy-handle" should be a child node
of this node. See phy.txt for the generic PHY bindings.

Optional properties:
- phy-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs one
- phy-io-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs a another one for I/O.
		 This is sometimes found with RGMII PHYs, which use a second
		 regulator for the lower I/O voltage.
- allwinner,tx-delay: The setting of the TX clock delay chain
- allwinner,rx-delay: The setting of the RX clock delay chain

The TX/RX clock delay chain settings are board specific.

Optional properties for "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac":
- allwinner,use-internal-phy: Use the H3 SoC's internal E(thernet) PHY
- allwinner,leds-active-low: EPHY LEDs are active low

When the internal PHY is requested, the implementation shall configure the
internal PHY to use the address specified in the child PHY node.

Example:

emac: ethernet@01c0b000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac";
	reg = <0x01c0b000 0x104>, <0x01c00030 0x4>;
	reg-names = "emac", "syscon";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&bus_gates 17>, <&bus_gates 128>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "ephy";
	resets = <&ahb_rst 17>, <&ahb_rst 66>;
	reset-names = "ahb", "ephy";
	phy = <&phy1>;
	allwinner,use-internal-phy;
	allwinner,leds-active-low;

	phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
		reg = <1>;
	};
};
