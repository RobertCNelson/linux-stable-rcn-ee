PRU-ICSS on TI SoCs
===================

The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
(PRU-ICSS) is present on various TI SoCs such as AM335x or AM437x or a
Keystone 66AK2G. A PRUSS consists of dual 32-bit RISC cores (Programmable
Real-Time Units, or PRUs), shared RAM, data and instruction RAMs, some
internal peripheral modules to facilitate industrial communication, and
an interrupt controller. The programmable nature of the PRUs provide
flexibility to implement custom peripheral interfaces, fast real-time
responses, or specialized data handling. The common peripheral modules
include the following,
  - an Ethernet MII_RT module with two MII ports
  - an MDIO port to control external Ethernet PHYs
  - an Industrial Ethernet Peripheral (IEP) to manage/generate Industrial
    Ethernet functions
  - an Enhanced Capture Module (eCAP)
  - an Industrial Ethernet Timer with 7/9 capture and 16 compare events
  - a 16550-compatible UART to support PROFIBUS

A PRU-ICSS subsystem can have up to three shared data memories. A PRU core
acts on a primary Data RAM (there are usually 2 Data RAMs) at its address
0x0, but also has access to a secondary Data RAM (primary to the other PRU
core) at its address 0x2000. A shared Data RAM, if present, can be accessed
by both the PRU cores. The Interrupt Controller (INTC) and a CFG module are
common to both the PRU cores. Each PRU core also has a private instruction RAM,
and specific register spaces for Control and Debug functionalities.

Various sub-modules within a PRU-ICSS subsystem are represented as individual
nodes and are defined using a parent-child hierarchy depending on their
integration within the IP and the SoC. These nodes are described in the
following sections.


PRU-ICSS SoC Bus Parent Node
=============================
This node represents the integration of the PRU-ICSS IP into a SoC, and is
required for all SoCs. The PRU-ICSS parent nodes need to be defined as child
nodes of this node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be one of,
                       "ti,am3356-pruss-soc-bus" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pruss-soc-bus" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pruss-soc-bus" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pruss-soc-bus" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg            : address and size of the PRUSS CFG sub-module registers
                   dictating the interconnect configuration
- #address-cells : should be 1
- #size-cells    : should be 1
- ranges         : standard ranges definition

SoC-specific Required properties:
---------------------------------

The following are mandatory properties for all OMAP-architecture based SoCs:
- ti,hwmods      : name of the hwmod associated with the PRUSS instance

The following properties are _required_ only for Keystone 2 66AK2G SoCs only:
- power-domains  : Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node and an
                   args specifier containing the PRUSS SCI device id value. This
                   property is as per the binding,
                       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/sci-pm-domain.txt


PRU-ICSS Parent Node
=====================
Each PRU-ICSS subsystem instance is represented as a child node of
the PRUSS SoC bus node, with the individual PRU processor cores, a
memories node, an INTC node and an MDIO node represented as child nodes
within this parent PRUSS node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be one of,
                       "ti,am3356-pruss" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pruss" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pruss" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pruss" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size of the entire PRU-ICSS space
- interrupts     : all the interrupts generated towards the main host
                   processor in the SoC. The format depends on the
                   interrupt specifier for the particular SoC's MPU
                   parent interrupt controller
- interrupt-names: should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
                   the name should match the corresponding host interrupt
                   number,
                       "host2", "host3", "host4", "host5", "host6",
                       "host7", "host8" or "host9"
                   NOTE: AM437x and 66AK2G SoCs do not have "host7" interrupt
                         connected to MPU
- #address-cells : should be 1
- #size-cells    : should be 1
- ranges         : no specific range translations required, child nodes have the
                   same address view as the parent, so should be mentioned without
                   any value for the property


PRU-ICSS Memories Node
=======================
The various Data RAMs within a PRU-ICSS are represented as a single
node with the name 'memories'.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- reg            : base address and size for each of the Data RAMs as
                   mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as the
                   reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain a string(s) from among the following names,
                   each representing a specific Data RAM region. A PRU-ICSS may
                   not have all of the Data RAMs. The binding is agnostic
                   of the order of these reg-names
                       "dram0" for Data RAM0,
                       "dram1" for Data RAM1,
                       "shrdram2" for Shared Data RAM,


PRU-ICSS SysCon Nodes
======================
The individual sub-modules CFG, IEP and MII_RT are represented as a syscon
node each for now with specific node names as below:
                  "cfg" for CFG sub-module,
                  "iep" for IEP sub-module,
                  "mii_rt" for MII-RT sub-module,


PRUSS INTC Child Node
======================
Each PRUSS has a single interrupt controller instance that is common to both
the PRU cores. Each interrupt controller can detect 64 input events which are
then mapped to 10 possible output interrupts through two levels of mapping. The
input events can be triggered by either the PRUs and/or various other PRUSS
internal and external peripherals. The first 2 output interrupts are fed
exclusively to the internal PRU cores, with the remaining 8 connected to
external interrupt controllers including the MPU.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible           : should be one of,
                             "ti,am3356-pruss-intc" for AM335x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am4376-pruss-intc" for AM437x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am5728-pruss-intc" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                             "ti,k2g-pruss-intc" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg                  : base address and size for the PRUSS INTC sub-module
- reg-names            : should contain the string "intc"
- interrupt-controller : mark this node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells     : should be 1. Client users shall use the PRU System
                         event number (the interrupt source that the client
                         is interested in) as the value of the interrupts
                         property in their node


PRU Child Node
===============
Each PRUSS has dual PRU cores, each represented by a PRU child node. Each node
can optionally be rendered inactive by using the standard DT string property,
"status".

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be
                       "ti,am3356-pru" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pru" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pru" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pru" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size for each of the 3 sub-module address
                   spaces as mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as
                   the reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain each of the following 3 names, the binding is
                   agnostic of the order of these reg-names
                       "iram" for Instruction RAM,
                       "control" for the CTRL sub-module registers,
                       "debug" for the Debug sub-module registers,
- firmware-name  : should contain the name of the default firmware image file
                   located on the firmware search path


MDIO Child Node
================
Each PRUSS has an MDIO module that can be used to control external PHYs. The
MDIO module used within the PRU-ICSS is an instance of the MDIO Controller
used in TI Davinci SoCs. Please refer to the corresponding binding document,
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/davinci-mdio.txt for details.
