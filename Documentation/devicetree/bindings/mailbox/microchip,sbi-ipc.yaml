description:
  The Microchip Inter-processor Communication (IPC) is used to exchange
  data between processors. It provides the ability to send and receive
  messages through a non-blocking interrupt signaling mechanism.
  This SBI interface is compatible with the Mi-V Inter-hart
  Communication (IHC) IP.
  The microchip,sbi-ipc compatible string is inteded for use by software
  running in s-mode. The SoC-specific compatibles are inteded for use
  by the SBI implementation (m-mode).

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - microchip,sbi-ipc
      - microchip,miv-ihc-rtl-v2

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 5

  interrupt-names:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 5

  "#mbox-cells":
    description:
      For the SBI "device", the cell represents the global "logical" channel IDs.
      The meaning of channel IDs are platform firmware dependent. The
      SoC-specific compatibles are intended for use by the SBI implementation,
      rather than s-mode software. There the cell would represent the physical
      channel and do not vary depending on platform firmware.
