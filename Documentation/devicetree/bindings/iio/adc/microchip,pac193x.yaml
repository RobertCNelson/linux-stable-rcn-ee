title: Microchip pac193x family of power monitors

description: |
   The PAC193{1,2,4} are [one,two,four] channel power/energy monitors with current sensor
   amplifier and bus voltage monitors that feed high resolution ADCs. Digital circuitry
   performs power calculations and energy accumulation. The sampling rate and energy
   integration period can be controlled over I2C. Active channel selection, one-shot
   measurements and other controls are also configurable by I2C
