title: Microchip IPC Remote Processor

description:
  Microchip family of RISC-V SoCs typically have one or more
  clusters. These clusters can be configured to run in an Asymmetric
  Multi Processing (AMP) mode where clusters are split in independent
  software contexts.

  This document defines the binding for the remoteproc component that
  loads and boots firmwares on remote clusters.

  This SBI interface is compatible with the Mi-V Inter-hart
  Communication (IHC) IP.

      This property is required only if the rpmsg/virtio functionality is used.
      Microchip IPC mailbox specifier. To be used for communication with a
      remote cluster. The specifier format is as per the bindings,

      If defined, when remoteproc is probed, it loads the default firmware and
      starts the remote processor.

      If present, a phandle for a reserved memory area that used for vdev buffer,
      resource table, vring region and others used by remote cluster.
