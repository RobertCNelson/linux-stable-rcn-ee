description:
  The AM625 TI Keystone OpenLDI transmitter (OLDI TX) supports serialized RGB
  pixel data transmission between host and flat panel display over LVDS (Low
  Voltage Differential Sampling) interface. The OLDI TX consists of 7-to-1 data
  serializers, and 4-data and 1-clock LVDS outputs. It supports the LVDS output
  formats "jeida-18", "jeida-24" and "vesa-18", and can accept 24-bit RGB or
  padded and un-padded 18-bit RGB bus formats as input.

    description:
      phandle to companion OLDI transmitter. This property is mandatory for the
      primarty OLDI TX if the OLDI TXes are expected to work either in dual-lvds
      mode or in clone mode. This property should point to the secondary OLDI
      TX.

  ti,secondary-oldi:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Boolean property to mark the OLDI transmitter as the secondary one, when the
      OLDI hardware is expected to run as a companion HW, in cases of dual-lvds
      mode or clone mode. The primary OLDI hardware is responsible for all the
      hardware configuration.

    description:
      phandle to syscon device node mapping OLDI IO_CTRL registers found in the
      control MMR region. These registers are required to toggle the I/O lane
      power, and control its electrical characteristics.
