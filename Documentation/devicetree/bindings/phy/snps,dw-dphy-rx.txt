Synopsys DesignWare MIPI Rx D-PHY block details

Description
-----------

The Synopsys MIPI D-PHY controller supports MIPI-DPHY in receiver mode.
Please refer to phy-bindings.txt for more information.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Shall be "snps,dw-dphy-rx".
- #phy-cells		: Must be 1.
- bus-width		: Size of the test interface data bus (8 bits->8 or
			  12bits->12).
- snps,dphy-frequency	: Frequency at which D-PHY should start, configurable.
			  Check Synopsys databook. (-kHz)
- reg			: Test interface register. This correspondes to the
			  physical base address of the controller and size of
			  the device memory mapped registers; Check Synopsys
			  databook.

Example:

	mipi_dphy_rx1: dphy@d00003040 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-dphy-rx";
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		bus-width = <12>;
		snps,dphy-frequency = <300000>;
		reg = <0xd0003040 0x20>;
	};
